### manim4ai

manim4ai is a layout and animation utility built on top of Manim, designed to manage the 
positioning and animation of multiple Mobjects with automatic collision detection and layout
validation. It helps ensure clean, readable animations—especially useful when generating flowcharts,
diagrams, or AI-explained visualizations.

### Features
- ✅ Object layout manager with animation sequencing.
- 🚧 Static checks for:
-Too many objects per frame
- Out-of-bounds object trajectories
- Colliding animation paths (with support for exception groups)
- 🔁 Supports user-defined animation functions.
- 📦 Uses Shapely for geometric reasoning.

### Limitations
- Designed for 2D Animations.
